This Privacy Policy applies only to those websites, services and applications included within “Services” and doesn’t apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services</p>
        <p></p>
        <b>Collection and Use of PII</b>
        <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>
        <p></p>
        <b>Here are some examples of the types of PII we may collect and how we may use it.
        </b>
        <br>
        <b>How we collect and use information
        </b>
        <p>When you register we may collect a variety of information, including your name, email address,  (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”).</p>
        <br>
        <b>How we use your PII</b>
        <p>The PII we collect allows us to keep yo u posted on HeroCams's latest Services and updates. HeroCam and affiliates  may share PII with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our Services. We also use PII to help us develop, deliver, and improve our Services. From time to time, we may use your PII to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by unregistering at unsubscribe@…………………..
        We may also use PII for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve HeroCam Services and customer communications.
        </p>
        <br>
        <b>Disclosure to Third Parties</b>
        <p>At times HeroCam may make certain PII available to strategic partners that work with HeroCam. to provide products and services, or that help HeroCam market to customers. PII will only be shared by Herocam. to provide or improve our Services; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Service Providers</b>
        <p>Herocam shares PII with companies who provide services such as hosting, information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Others</b>
        <p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for HeroCam. to disclose your PII. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all PII we collect to the relevant third party.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Protection of PII</b>
        <p>Herocam takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your PII against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

When you use HeroCam Apps or post on an social networking service, the PII you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the PII you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Integrity and Retention of PII</b>
        <p>We will retain your PII for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
        </p>
        <br>
        <b>Access to PII (option out - optout)</b>
        <p>For other PII, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to such PII so you can request that we correct or delete the PII we have about you. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by contacting ………………………….</p>
        <br>
        <b>Children</b>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the PII of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Location-Based Services</b>
        <p>In order to provide better user experience and give a more personal approach to the gameplay,  our service uses location information. We may use location information to improve and personalise our Services for you. We also use location information to help us develop, deliver, and improve our Services.</p>

Your use of the Services followed by your submission of any PII represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
         <br>
